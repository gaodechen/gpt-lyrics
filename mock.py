[start]
I feel the sun's last light fading away
A sweet reminder of a love that's here to stay
We laughed at secrets and shared secrets we never knew
The sky is turning a deep shade of blue

Lost in an endless embrace in the twilight hours
Our love keeps on burning, even with the stars ablaze
We watch the sky, your eyes deep in mine
We hold each other until the sun starts to rise

The sun sets, our love never ends
Your warmth forever deep in my soul
We'll be together until the river runs dry
Our hearts connected, here comes the night

This love will never die, it's burning in me
My love for you will never cease, it's where I find peace
My heart will never forget, the beauty of our sunset
[end]
